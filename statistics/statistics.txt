bias:
    - the inability of machine learning algorithm to capture
      the true relationship in the data
    - high bias -> the algorithm cannot represent the data accurately
    - low bias -> the algorithm is able to represent data accurately
    - zero bias -> the algorithm represent the data perfectly

variance:
    - also called variability
    - the difference in fit between datasets
    - high variance -> the algorithm fits one dataset very well and other dataset very bad
    - low variance -> the algorithm fits both the dataset equally
                        -- equally good  OR
                        -- equally bad
