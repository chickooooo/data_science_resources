variables:
    - categorical : data that can be categorised
    - numerical (quantitive) : numerical data

categorical:
    - nominal : which describes something
    - ordinal : have an inherent ranking
    - binary : 2 possible values

numerical (quantitive):
    - continuous
    - discrete

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

spread of dataset:
    - for highly skewed data or data with extreme outliers, we therefore might prefer to use IQR or MAD
    - for data that is more normally distributed, the variance and standard deviation are frequently reported

quantitive and categorical variable summary statistics:
    - we can use a mean or median difference

quantitive and quantitive variable summary statistics:
    - we can use the Pearson correlation

categorical and categorical variable summary statistics:
    - we can use a contingency table and the Chi-Square statistic

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

measures for central tendency (quantitive data) :
    - mean: sum of all the values / no. of values
    - median: middle value when sorted
    - mode: value with most frequency
    - trimmed mean: the mean excluding x % of lowest and highest value

measures for spread (quantitive data) :
    - range: difference between the maximum and minimum values
    - inter-quartile range (IQR): difference between the 75th and 25th percentile values
    - variance: average of the squared distance from each data point to the mean
    - standard deviation: square root of variance
    - mean absolute deviation: mean absolute value of the distance between each data point and the mean

five types of data analysis:
    - descriptive
    - exploratory
    - inferential
    - causal
    - predictive

descriptive analysis:
    - it let us draw basic conclusions about the data at hand
    - we cannot extend findings from descriptive analysis to other datasets

exploratory analysis:
    - it show us underlying patterns and relationships within datasets
    - it cannot determine causation

inferential analysis:
    - it lets us test a hypothesis on a sample of a population and then extend our conclusions to the whole population

causal analysis:
    - correlation does not equal causation
    - proving causation is tricky and generally requires very careful experimental design
    - replication, randomization, and control are key components of good experimental design

predictive analysis:
    - supervised machine learning algorithms are trained with labeled data and predict the likelihood of future outcome
    - they can only be as good as the data used to train them

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

covariance:
    - it is a summary statistic that describes the strength of a linear relationship
    - it can range from negative infinity to positive infinity
    - a positive covariance indicates that a larger value of one variable is associated with a larger value of the other

correlation:
    - it is a scaled form of covariance
    - it ranges from -1 to +1, making it more interpretable
    - highly associated variables with a positive linear relationship will have a correlation close to +1
    - generally, a correlation larger than about 0.3 indicates a linear association
    - and correlation greater than about 0.6 suggestions a strong linear association

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

contingency tables:
    - contingency tables, also known as two-way tables or cross-tabulations, are useful for summarizing two variables at the same time

marginal proportions:
    - the proportion of respondents in each category of a single question is called a marginal proportion

chi-square statistic:
    - to calculate the Chi Square statistic, we simply find the squared difference between each value in the observed table and
      itsâ€™ corresponding value in the expected table; then add up those numbers
    - for a 2x2 table, a Chi-Square statistic larger than around 4 would strongly suggest an association between the variables
