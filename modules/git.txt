- commit:
    -  git commit -m "message"         (take current snapshot)

    -- takes snapshot of directory
    -- only looks at changes made to the directory instead of copying whole directory
    -- each commit is dependent on it's ancestor commit
    -- very lightweight and fast to switch between


- branches:
    -  git branch branch_name          (create new branch)
    -  git checkout branch_name        (move pointer to given branch)
    -  git checkout -b branch_name     (creat new branch and move pointer to it)

    -- incredibly lightweight
    -- pointers to a specific commit


- merging branches:
    -  git merge branch_name           (merge given branch with current branch (branch with pointer))

    -- 1st way of combining branches
    -- a special commit with 2 unique parents
    -- if one of the parent is ancestor of another,
       then the ancestor parent will simply move to the latest parent


- rebase:
    -  git rebase branch_name          (merge given branch with current branch linearly)

    -- 2nd way of combining branches
    -- used to make a linear sequence of commits
    -- takes a sequence of commits, copies them and plops them down somewhere else
    -- cleaner commit history
    -- if one of the parent is ancestor of another,
       then the ancestor parent will simply move to the latest parent
